# Javascript Astrolabe

A astrolabe renderer written in javascript using [d3](http://d3js.org)

Many thanks to James Morrison for his book [The Astrolabe](http://www.astrolabes.org/pages/theastrolabe.htm). This project uses calculation methods derived in that book.

This project is not complete. Likely soon a new calculation method will be implemented using d3.projections to calculate the stereographic projection.

Forks and contributions welcomed.
